### Groupie Tracker Project

This repository contains files from a project completed at 01 Founders Coding School.

The objective is to receive a given API and manipulate the data contained in it, in order to create a site, displaying the information.

The finished website can be viewed [here](https://groupie-tracker-asy.herokuapp.com/) hosted on heroku.

This project introduced me to :

- Manipulation and storage of data.
- JSON files and format.
- HTML.
- Event creation and display.
- Client-server.
